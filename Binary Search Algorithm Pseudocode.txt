Binary Search Algorithm:

1.	Sort data in ascending order. Find the middle number of the array.
2.	If the search target is less than the middle number, go to Step 3. If the search target is greater than the middle number, go to Step 4. If the middle number is the search target, end search.
3.	Perform new search using the middle number from the previous Step as the new highest bound of the list. Find the middle number again. Repeat Step 2
4.	Perform new search using the middle number from the previous Step as the new lowest bound of the list. Find the new middle number. Repeat Step 2.


Binary Search Pseudo Code:

int lowBound = lowest entry in list
int highBound = highest entry in list
int midPoint = middle entry in list
int target = user’s search target

while(lowBound is less than highBound)
    midPoint = (lowBound + highBound) / 2
    if midPoint = target
        print(“target found”)
        break
    else if target is less than midPoint
        highBound = midPoint - 1
    else if target is greater than midPoint
        lowBound = midPoint + 1
